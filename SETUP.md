# Installation

## Prebuilt official releases
These releases can be found [here](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/CoffinTone/releases) and are as up to date as they need to be for the CoffinSMP. The version in the newest release is for the CoffinSMP's current Minecraft version. A new release will be made when the server's version changes.

These are installed as you would normally install mods, drag the .jar into your mods folder and launch the game with your preferred loader.

## Building
Same as Baritone, see [Baritone's 1.20.2 SETUP.md](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/1.20.2/SETUP.md) for instructions.
